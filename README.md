# contrail-charms
Juju charms for Contrail services.

Overview
--------

Contrail 5.0 would provide support for Docker containers. The existing contrail components, which run as services on a BMS or VM, would be running within a Docker container in contrail 5.0.
This document describes how to deploy contrail 5.0 Docker containers, which would be running the several contrail service components using contrail-charms

[Contrail-charms specs](specs/contrail-charms.md)

Deploying Contrail charms
-------------------------

1. Install cloud and juju on the dedicated machine from where the deploy is started:
```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install juju
```
[Installing juju](https://docs.jujucharms.com/2.4/en/getting-started)

2. Configure juju:
```
juju add-cloud <cloud-name>
juju add-credential <cloud name>
```

You can see possible clouds that you can use with `juju clouds` command.
```
$ juju clouds
Cloud        Regions  Default          Type        Description
aws               15  us-east-1        ec2         Amazon Web Services

aws-gov            1  us-gov-west-1    ec2         Amazon (USA Government)

localhost          1  localhost        lxd         LXD Container Hypervisor
```

You can add private or custom clouds for the following provider types:
```
$ juju add-cloud
Cloud Types
  maas
  manual
  openstack
  oracle
  vsphere
```

As an example for maas:
```
juju add-cloud mymaas       #select cloud type: maas, enter the API endpoint url)
juju add-credential mymaas  #add credentials
```

[Using MAAS with Juju](https://docs.jujucharms.com/2.4/en/clouds-maas)

As an example for amazon:
```
juju add-credential aws   #add credentials
```

[Using Amazon with Juju](https://docs.jujucharms.com/2.4/en/help-aws)

3. Create controller:
```
juju bootstrap --bootstrap-series=xenial <cloud name> <controller name>
```
[Bootstrapping controller](https://docs.jujucharms.com/2.4/en/controllers-creating)

4. Download charms:
```
git clone https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-charms -b R5
```

5. Deploy Contrail:

  You can deploy charms in bundle or manually.

  [Charm bundles](https://docs.jujucharms.com/2.4/en/charms-bundles)

- With bundle:
    - Create or modify the Juju deployment bundle yaml file to point to machines in which the contrail-charms should be deployed and to include options you need.
    - Deploy the bundle using the command `juju deploy <bundle_yaml_file>`
    - [Example of bundle.yaml file for deployment of OpenStack and Contrail in Amazon environment for Ubuntu 18.04.](examples/contrail-openstack-bionic/bundle.yaml)
    - [Example of bundle.yaml file for deployment of OpenStack and Contrail without analyticsdb in Amazon environment for Ubuntu 18.04.](examples/contrail-openstack-without-analyticsdb-bionic/bundle.yaml)
    - [Example of bundle.yaml file for deployment of OpenStack and Contrail in Amazon environment for Ubuntu 20.04.]
    - [Example of bundle.yaml file for deployment of Kubernetes and Contrail in Amazon environment.](examples/contrail-k8s/bundle.yaml)
    - [Example of bundle.yaml file for deployment of Kubernetes and Contrail in Nested mode.](examples/contrail-k8s-nested/bundle.yaml)
    - [Example of bundle.yaml file for Contrail CNI (K8S) Deployment Using Existing Keystone.](examples/contrail-hybrid-k8s-openstack/bundle.yaml)

- Manually

    [How to deploy Contrail with OpenStack](./manual-deploy.md)

    [How to deploy Contrail with Kubernetes](./manual-deploy-kubernetes.md)

    [Using the Manual cloud with Juju](https://docs.jujucharms.com/2.4/en/clouds-manual)

    * Analyticsdb is optional and can be omitted. In this case analyticsdb, alarm and snmp will not be installed.

6. You can check the status of your deployment using `juju status` command.
[Unit status. Juju documentation.](https://docs.jujucharms.com/2.4/en/reference-status)


Contrail's multi interface setup
--------------------------------
CTRL/DATA network - network for data traffic of workload and for control traffic between compute nodes and control services.
API/MGMT network - network where API services are listening on and for accessing instances.

By default, charms are using the default network for API/MGMT and CTRL/DATA.

To specify API/MGMT network set `control-network` parameter for contrail-controller and contrail-analytics. If contrail-analyticsdb or contrail-kubernetes-master is applied set `control-network` parameter for it as well. It can be the IP addresses with netmasks of the control network or physical device name.

To specify CTRL/DATA network set `data-network` parameter for contrail-controller. It can be the IP addresses with netmasks of the control network or physical device name. If `data-network` isn't specified it will use the same network as `control-network`.

```
juju config contrail-controller control-network=192.168.0.0/24 data-network=ens4
juju config contrail-analytics control-network=192.168.0.0/24
juju config contrail-analyticsdb control-network=192.168.0.0/24
```

When contollers are placed in different AZ/networks then it can be possible to specify like this:

```
juju config contrail-controller control-network="192.168.0.0/24 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.2.0/24" data-network=ens4
```

In this case each controller will choose the address from its own network.
